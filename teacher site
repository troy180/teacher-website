      <h2>About the 7th Grade English Teacher  </h2> <hr> 
      <p>I teach 7th Grade ELA and 7th Grade Creative Dramatics and I am also the drama director. This is my fifth year at Carroll. I attended college at IU Kokomo. The only other job I have had was that I tutored and helped at an after-school program while in college. 

        I have always had a great interest in Language Arts and wanted to foster the same enjoyment in others. 

        My goal is to help students become better readers and writers. I also want to help grow the drama program and make it successful.

        My peers would describe me as laid back. 
      </p>
